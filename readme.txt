When programming optimized high level applications it is sometimes a pain just to use C for one thing then go back to assembly. This is a little thing I made to optimize the sending part of TCP, but more so to make network programming easier in assembly.

27328 is the best number in the world so that is why I chose it for dummy numbers. Disagree? Well check out this illuminati mathz:
27328 - 666 = 26662
26662 >> 6 = 416
416 * 1.6 = 665.6
665.6 + .4 = 666
Do that mathz backwards and that is an easy way to memorize 27328.
